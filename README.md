# Interest App

The concept for this app was born out of my experience with owing Kuda. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the tracking of all accrued interests and provide insights into future interest projections

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Date Object
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Whatever you imagine is very much possible. My guiding principle, if you can't do great things, do small things in a great way. Don't be about perfection (clean codes, DRY codes, pure function), you can do it when you've completed

```html

```
```css

```
```js

```


### Continued development

Learn more about the date object. Also, to imporve my motion design
